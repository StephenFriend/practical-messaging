# Protocol #

Rabbit MQ (RMQ) uses the open-standard Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

AMQP 0-9-1 consists of both the AMQ model, which defines a server model of exchanges, queues, and bindings and the AMQ wire-protocol which defines how frames are sent between client and server.

AMQP 1-0 does not use the AMQ model, and is a major change from AMQP 0-9-1.

RMQ is unlikely to move to the 1-0 version as it is highly dependent on the AMQ model
