# Overview #

The management console is divided into a series of tabs, which list instances of the AMQP primitives: Connections, Channels, Exchanges and Queues as well as providing an Administration page.

The overview page also provides diagnostics on the server itself.

Individual pages allow you to see the state of those primitives as well as define their properties. For example, highlighting an Exchange on the Exchanges tab allows you to see the bindings on that Exchange, add new bindings and publish messages to the Exchange.
